<h1><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Your First Model</font></h1>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">Initial version of
this tutorial was made by Smoke</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">OK peeps, this is the fun part !</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Your first Quake Model (unless
you've already made one) is going to be a spiffy new animated
missile for the Rocket Launcher ! </font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Creating a frame</font></h2>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First we are going to
create a single frame that we will use as the starting point for
our model. You create and edit the 3D frame with the </font><a
href="frameeditor.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">frame editor</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial">.</font></p>

<h4 align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Setting up the frame
editor</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before we start, we need to set up
the frame editor so you can see the model fairly well. Make sure
you have opened the editor by clicking the <img
src="frameedit.gif" width="23" height="23">button.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are first going to change the
background color of the frame editor. To do this click
&quot;Options|Edit&quot; in the menu bar. It will bring up the </font><a
href="optioneditor.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">options
dialog</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">, now click the tab
that says &quot;Frame editor&quot; you will see a group with a
caption saying &quot;Background color&quot;. In this group there
will be a little box with a number and the words &quot;Palette
index&quot; in front of it. Now press the button with
&quot;...&quot; on it to bring up a color palette. OK select a
color in the top row of the palette that looks like a nice gray
not too light and not too dark. After you click a color the
palette index should be set somewhere in the range 7 to 10.
That's where mine is set, most of the gfx in Quake are dark and
this gray color will allow you to see the objects better. Don't
select white unless your ready to be blinded :) OK now close the
options dialog by pressing the OK button</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now back to the frame editor.
Because we want to be able to line-up vertices later on, you
should press down the <img src="perspbtn.gif" width="23"
height="22"> button, to get parallel projection instead of
perspective projection.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because a missile is a relatively
small model, we need to setup the viewer to get a close-up look
of the model, select a zoom factor of 900 % using the <img
src="zoombtn.gif" width="25" height="24"> button.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You will need to insert a lot of
objects from the object library in this tutorial. So if you can't
find the object library palette in the upper right corner of the
qME </font><a href="mainwindow.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">main
window</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> you have a problem.
You should see something like this...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="prefabpalette.gif"
width="143" height="53"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If for some strange reason you
can't find it, then something went wrong during installation of
qME. If you do see the geometry tab, then just skip to the next
paragraph. The &quot;geometry&quot; tab is nothing more than a
directory on you hard disk, so you need to find and select the
directory that <strong>contains</strong> the &quot;geometry&quot;
directory Let me repeat that... you need to find the directory
that <strong>contains </strong>the &quot;geometry&quot;
directory. You can change the directory by using the </font><a
href="optioneditor.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">options
dialog</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> under the general
tab and then select OK after you have set the path to the object
library correctly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now we've got all that setup, we
are ready to start editing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Keep in mind that you can use
these <img src="NAI10.jpg" width="130" height="22"> buttons to
select different views to help line things up and I highly
suggest it!</font></p>

<h4><font size="2" face="Arial">Creating a fin for our rocket</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we are going to do first is
create a fin for our rocket. Because there will be two fins in
our model, we are going to create a prefab fin model that we can
insert twice.</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Insert a cube by pressing the
        <img src="box.gif" width="25" height="24"> button on the
        object library palette.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Hit the <img
        src="objectscale.gif" width="25" height="25"> button to
        get the object scale tool.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Click on the cube to select
        it, then put a cursor in the scale boxes and scale the
        cube down to .4 .7 .2. If you have typed in a value,
        hitting the return key will actually set the value, but
        also going to another edit box will set it.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now hit the <img
        src="vtxbtn.gif" width="24" height="24">&nbsp;button to
        edit the vertices to make our cube look more like a fin.
        Viewed from above with the render mode set to wireframe
        this should look something like this:</font></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="topfinwire.gif"
    width="167" height="150"></font></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li value="5"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now select
        &quot;File|Save Model&quot; from the menu and save the
        model in a file called &quot;FIN.MDL&quot;. Remember
        where you put it, you will need it shortly.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Note</strong>, you also
could put the fin into the object library. If you save the fin in
a directory on the same level as the geometry directory or in the
geometry directory itself, and you select
&quot;Options|Edit&quot; followed by clicking OK, the object
palette will be updated and your model will be available from the
object library.</font></p>

<h4><font size="2" face="Arial">Creating the rocket</font></h4>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Lets start from scratch again
        by selecting &quot;File|New Model&quot; .</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now press the <img
        src="sphere.gif" width="24" height="24"> button on the
        object library palette to put a sphere into your model.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Hit the <img
        src="objectscale.gif" width="25" height="25"> button to
        get the object scale tool.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Click on the sphere to select
        it, then put a cursor in the scale boxes and scale the
        sphere down to .3 .3 .3.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now insert a cylinder <img
        src="cylinder.gif" width="25" height="24"> and scale it
        down to .7 .2 .2, pretty easy eh? </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now for some confusion, do
        you see the colored lines? Good. Now, the blue line faces
        the front of the model, we are making a missile so we
        want the shaft (shaft = the cylinder you just added) to
        point away from the front, like a tail. I'm not going to
        show you exactly how to do it cause you have to learn how
        to use the program sometime, but you should select the
        object move tool<img src="objectmove.gif" width="25"
        height="25"> to move objects around. Anyway, you'll know
        when this isn't lined up right when you launch a missile
        and it fly's sideways towards its destination :).
        Anyway...after scaling the cylinder down, line it up
        using the object move tool, so it sticks out of the
        sphere and starts to look somewhat like a weird missile.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now we need to insert our
        fins into the model. Select &quot;File|Merge Model&quot;
        and select your prefab &quot;FIN.MDL&quot;. You will see
        that a fin is merged into your model.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Hit the <img
        src="objectrot.gif" width="25" height="24"> button to get
        the object rotate tool and select the fin you just
        inserted. Put the cursor in the rotate boxes and rotate
        the object to 90,0,0.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now we need to insert the
        second fin into the model. Select &quot;File|Merge
        Model&quot; and select the &quot;FIN.MDL&quot; again.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Use the object move tool <img
        src="objectmove.gif" width="25" height="25"> to move the
        fins to where a fin on a missile would go. Note that
        these fins are supposed to stick out of BOTH sides of the
        shaft. Just mess around with the fins until they look
        good.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now insert a cone from the
        object library palette. Rotate it 90 degrees on the Y
        axis (hint: X </font><font color="#FFFF00" size="2"
        face="Arial">Y </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Z).
        Scale it down to .2 .2 .2 and put it on the end of the
        shaft so it looks like a flame.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, since this is a missile
        from the Rocket Launcher we want it to glow and smoke so
        we click this <img src="editprop.gif" width="24"
        height="23">&nbsp;button. You should see the </font><a
        href="modelpropeditor.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">model
        properties editor</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">
        now. In there you will see a check box under
        &quot;Flags&quot; marked &quot;Rocket Smoke Trail&quot;
        put a check mark in it and click OK. That will make the
        model have the &quot;EF_ROCKET&quot; flag and when shown
        in Quake it will glow and smoke. Cool eh? :)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Read on, to find out how to paint
on your newly created model.</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Painting a skin</font></h2>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can paint on the
skin in either 2D with the skin texture editor or in 3D directly
on the model in the frame editor. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To use the 2D skin
texture editor, click this <img src="skinedit.gif" width="23"
height="23"> button. You can also paint the skin with an external
paint program, just export it, paint on it and import it again. I
will teach you how to export or paint it within qME, I won't
teach you how to use a different program to paint it though :).</font></p>

<h4 align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Internal painting</font></h4>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Select the <img
        src="penbtn.gif" width="25" height="23">&nbsp;button to
        get the pencil.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To select the color you want
        to use in painting, select a color from the color palette
        you normally find on the bottom of the main window. You
        also can right click on the skin to select a color
        already present in the skin itself.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Draw, either in the Skin
        Texture Editor or in the Frame Editor.</font></li>
</ol>

<h4 align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">External painting</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now if you want to paint your skin
in a different program (like Paint Shop Pro) this is what ya do.</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Click in the upper left panel
        that contains these <img src="skinoutline.gif" width="91"
        height="16"> lines.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Select the skin you want to
        paint on, in this case it will most likely be called
        &quot;new skin&quot;. To change the name of the skin
        click on the skin you want to rename and click the name
        label. After clicking it, the label will go into edit
        mode. Anyway, select the skin you want to export (NOTE:
        you MUST select a skin before you can export and if there
        are more than one skin, select the right one!) now use
        the &quot;File|Export Skin&quot; menu to save the skin.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Select a place and name for
        the file you are exporting and click OK.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fire up your fav paint
        program on it and DRAW! =Þ~</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">After drawing the skin in a
        different program you might want to import it into your
        new model. So, if you closed qME open it back up and open
        your model, click &quot;File|Import Skin&quot; menu to
        find the file that contains your skin and click OK.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now if the skin you just
        imported is not the FIRST in the list, grab it (left
        click drag) and drag it onto the first skin this will
        move it to the first place in the list. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Voila your first Quake model
        with qME ! Pretty easy huh? :)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Read on, to find out how to add
animation frames to your model.</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Animating the model</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now we are going to add some
animation frames. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we are trying to accomplish
here is making the rocket look more realistic during flight. If
you ever have seen a real missile launch from close by, you might
have noticed that these things behave quite differently from the
normal Quake missiles. In particular at take-off the missiles
control mechanisms that guide it make it jump wildly as it hurls
towards it target.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we are going to do is add a
client side animation. This means you can let Quake do the
animation playing without programming a single line of QC code !</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To create an animation this is
what you need to do.</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">First we need to set up the
        joints in the model. Joints are the animation parameters
        that define motion for the model. Select the root object
        in the </font><a href="mainwindow.htm#Object Tree Panel"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">object tree panel</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">, right click and select &quot;Edit
        Object Joints&quot; from the local menu.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now in the dialog you see
        now, check the TY and TZ boxes and give the joints the
        names &quot;left right&quot; and &quot;up down&quot;.
        Click close to close the dialog. We now have created two
        joints in our model that allow us to control the
        animation in the Joint Track Editor.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now select our single frame
        in the </font><a href="mainwindow.htm#Frame Tree Panel"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">frame tree panel</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">, right click and duplicate the
        frame 10 times, then duplicate the first frame again, so
        you get a total of 12 frames.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Well lets start animating !
        Open the </font><a href="jointtrackeditor.htm"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Joint Track Editor</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> by pressing the <img
        src="jointbtn.gif" width="23" height="22"> button and
        select the cells in the first column of the grid. Press
        the <img src="keyframebtn.gif" width="24" height="22">
        button to turn these two values into key values. The
        values turn now from gray in to black, which means you
        can change them. You need to double click the values to
        edit them.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="tut1joints.gif"
width="595" height="110"></font></p>

<ol type="1" start="5">
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Well go on with changing gray
        tween values into key values for frame 4, 6,7 and finally
        frame 10. If you are finished with changing the key
        values, press the <img src="updatebtn.gif" width="25"
        height="25"> button. This will calculate the in-between
        values and update the model. Your grid should now look
        exactly likethe one you see above.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now go to the frame editor
        and play the animation by using the green play button
        from the animation controls <img src="animctrls.gif"
        width="46" height="22"> and see how the rocket jumps up
        and down and moves from left to right.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally we need to instruct
        Quake that it needs to play the animation automatically.
        To do this, right click the scene in the frame tree panel
        and select &quot;Group Frames for Scene&quot; from the
        local menu. Now we are halfway there. Again select the
        scene and right click it again and choose &quot;Edit
        Duration of Frames for Scene&quot;. Make all durations
        '0.05' which will play back the animation at a framerate
        of 20 frames per second.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Read on to find out how you can
use your new rocket in Quake.</font></p>

<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial">Using your missile in Quake</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well this is what I got in the
end, does yours look anything like it ?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="myfirstmdl.gif"
width="199" height="55"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">OK, now you wanna see the thing in
Quake right? Right. This is what ya do. Let's assume you
installed Quake in C:\QUAKE\, then this is the root directory for
new game patches. If you installed Quake in another directory,
that's OK, use that directory in the description below whenever
you see C:\QUAKE\ in the text.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are going to create a new game
patch to view our missile. Use the explorer or a DOS box to
create the MYMDL sub directory directly under the game root. Then
create a PROGS sub directory directly under that one. The result
should be C:\QUAKE\MYMDL\PROGS\ . Now go back to qME and choose
&quot;File|Save As&quot; to save your model as MISSILE.MDL in the
PROGS directory you just created (You don't have to type the
extension, qME will automatically put &quot;.mdl&quot; at the
end!)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now you start a DOS box, change
the current directory to C:\QUAKE\ and type :</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">quake -game mymdl +map e1m1</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now once you're inside Quake bring
down the console with &quot;~&quot; and type &quot;impulse
9&quot; this will give you the rocket launcher and all other
weapons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now get ready for some serious
gibbing with your collection of spanking new rockets :)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you want to see your missile a
little less in motion, save it as GRENADE.MDL in the same PROGS
directory where you saved it as MISSILE.MDL, this will replace
the grenade with your missile model. You will then see your
missile bouncing of walls instead of the normal grenade.</font></p>
